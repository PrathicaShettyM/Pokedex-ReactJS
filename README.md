# Pokedex-ReactJS

### Key feature of the application :
1. Used `pokeapi` to fetch Pokemon data for the ReactJS frontend.
2. Used `axios` library to make http request to the `pokeapi` to fetch data.
3. Learnt to use `useEffect` and `Hooks` in React apps

### Hooks : 
4. Use of Debouncing Events to allow you to call a function that ensures that a time-consuming task does not fire so often
### Components : 
The app components include :
   a. Pokemon : to display the final UI of the pokemon application
   b. PokemonDetails : to fetch data from the api
   c. PokemonList : to initiate pagination feature to the app for better performance and user-experience
   d. SearchBar : to search for a particular Pokemon based on name
